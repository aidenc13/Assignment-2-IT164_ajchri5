This project serves primarily as a speech-to-text app that processes both live and recorded audio input, transcribing the speech in its detected language and translating it to English. This project uses a combination of models and libraries, including OpenAIâ€™s Whisper for transcription, Helsinki-NLP for translation, fastText for language detection, and Gradio for the user interface.
